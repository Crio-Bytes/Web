Hello Geeks, I hope you are doing great and fine as well. You all know about the terms "Investments, Funds and Financial Services" etc. You can able to invest your money via their sites or an app. In most cases, we all use their sites and invest our money so that they give us more. Here, our intention is not to invest our money, actually it's all about their sites. How their UI approaches? 

In this Microbyte, We will create a site named "EdgeLedger Financial | Accounting and Investment". This site remains a static website. You would need to mainly work on its UI i.e, some HTML and CSS.

Some of the best editor are Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text etc. You can even code in your Notepad that is preinstalled in windows but it is highly recommended to use IDE's/editor due to developer convinience. Here are the tutorials to download and setup the editors.
